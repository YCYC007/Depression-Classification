# Depression-Classification
### Title: 
Investigating the risk factors that affect depression among older adults in the United States: 
A latent class analysis with a distal outcome

### Background: 
The aging of the U.S. population is unavoidable, leading to various social-related issues. 
Older adults tend to encounter psychological and physical decline that may lead to depression. However, medical personnel, caregivers of the older adults, and even the older adults themselves tend to regard depression as a normal reaction to the distress mentioned above. Therefore, depression in the older adults is often underestimated, leading to the loss of treatment opportunities. This study aims to identify the unobserved patterns of healthy lifestyles and to examine their associations with depression among older adults over 65 years of age.

### Methods: 
Data from the 2017-2018 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used for the analyses. Participants aged over 65 were included in the study sample (n=1,368). A latent class model with the classify-analyze approach (two-step approach) was applied to identify healthy lifestyle subgroups based on five observed indicators related to depression risk (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical function, living status, and self-reported frequency of negative emotion). The distal outcome depression was measured as a dichotomous variable using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). A multinomial logistic regression was conducted to estimate the association between healthy lifestyle patterns and depression while controlling for the covariates. 

### Results: 
Three healthy lifestyle subgroups were found using latent class analysis with the five observed indicators. The odds of having depression for older adults in the “Moderate health risk” subgroup were 3.483 times (95% CI: 1.324-7.492, p < 0.05) of the odds for those in the “Low health risk” subgroup. The odds of having depression for older adults in the “High health risk” subgroup were 8.724 times (95% CI: 5.116-15.790, p < 0.05) of the odds for those in the “Low health risk” subgroup. 

### Conclusion: 
Older adults in the “High health risk” subgroup was associated with an increased probability of having depression. Relevant depression prevention and health promotion strategies must be tailored to target the different healthy lifestyle subgroups among older adults.
